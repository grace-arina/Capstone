## Proposal 1: ***Classification of Skin Lesions***
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/drscarlat/melanoma
- Build model that predicts whether a skin lesion is benign, malignant, or unknown
- Classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions

## Proposal 2: ***Classification of Sky Objects***
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17
- Classification, explore basic models: KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear SVC, and Decision Tree


## Proposal 3: ***Sephora***
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/sephora-products
- I want to find out if given some of the features about the products, such as the customer profiles or the product information, will there be patterns that can be discerned from the thousands of data points from the e-retailer. 
- I will model a regression of predicting the percentage of recommendation from reviewers for a product
- I will model a classification to find out if a product will have above or below average rating.
